# SVGKit

SVGKit is a Cocoa framework for rendering SVG files natively: it's fast and powerful.

Versions:
  - master - Current branch in development. Has code from SVGKit's 1.1.0  branch - https://github.com/SVGKit/SVGKit/tree/1.1.0
  - v1.1.0 - Branch that was used to merge changes from SVGKit's 1.1.0 branch from SVGKit's master. NOW DEFUNCT! It has been merged with master. Occasionally the branch will be used as a staging branch for merges to go back to master.
  - arc - Branch that has the iOS and OS X project use Automatic Reference Counting as well as "modern" (as of Xcode 4.6) Objective-C syntax.
  - imageRep - Branch that has OS X's SVGKit' image rep implemented. NOW DEFUNCT! It has been been merged back into master.
  - namespace - Branch that has the SVGKit headers better designed to work with OS X. Not actively maintained
  - toSVGKit - Branch that contains staged changes to put back into SVGKit's 1.1.0 branch.
  - patterns - Branch for working on pattern support. based off of SVGKit's 1.1.0 branch as opposed to my master. Parts have been merged back to master.

## Xcode Projects Included

For 2013, we have a major refactor/rewrite of the core SVGKit, fixing many bugs, adding many features, and making SVGKit much closer to meeting the SVG official Specification - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/

Because so much has changed, Adam wrote a series of blog posts to explain how to use the latest versions:

### Combined getting started info

WARNING: Due to some bugs in Apple's renderer, SVGKFastImageView doesn't render gradient-fills for anything except rectangles, and cannot use CoreAnimation. For higher accuracy (but slightly worse performance), use SVGKLayeredImageView instead.

Key methods / properties you might find useful:

  1. SVGKImage - all the magic happens here
  1. SVGKImage.DOMTree - a complete DOM tree of the "parsed" SVG/XML document, with ALL TAGS (even if unsupported by current SVGKit - they will be parsed anyway!)
  1. SVGKImage.CALayerTree - a complete, renderable, tree of Apple CALayer objects (only contains layers for features currently supported - if you find something missing, please submit a fix!)
  
## Advanced Features (this branch/fork only!)

There are many new features in this version (2013) of SVGKit. Read the blog posts above for more detail, but briefly:

  - use an SVG just like it's a normal PNG file: use SVGKFastImageView like it's UIImageView/NSImageView:
  - load an SVG from web, or from disk
  - search an SVG file for particular tags / nodes / elements:
  - automatic scaling of your SVG to fit their on-screen size (often reduces the memory required)
  - Access to the DOM Document Object Model
  - Retrieve any part of your SVG document positioned correctly in space
  - detailed information on whether and WHY parsing failed:

iPhone/iPad (iOS) Info
===

### Ultra-quick 'getting started'
-----

Open the project "Demo-iOS", select your preferred simulator (or device, if it's plugged in), build and run. Try the sample SVG's packaged with SVGKit.

To use SVGKit, either CREATE AND DISPLAY AN IMAGE ON SCREEN:

    [self.view addSubview: [[SVGKFastImageView alloc] initWithSVGKImage: [SVGKImage imageNamed:@"mySVGfile.svg"]]];

or LOAD AN IMAGE AND CONVERT TO A UIIMAGE OBJECT:

    UIImage* newImage = [SVGKImage imageNamed:@"mySVGfile"].UIImage;

## Installation

There is a sample project you can examine which embeds the entire SVGKit project into an application project. Many people like working this way (although Xcode isn't very good at it. Open the "Demo-iOS" project and poke around.

Alternatively, most people like to compile an embeddable library:
  1. Open the project "SVGKit-iOS"
  2. Select the target "SVGKit Library" from the dropdown build selector at top left
  3. Build
  4a. (open the Products section on left hand bar in Xcode, right click the product, and select "Show in Finder". THEN GO UP ONE DIRECTORY! You MUST NOT USE the Product that Xcode shows you - it IS WRONG, it is a BUG IN APPLE'S XCODE)
  4. Look in your output directory for a folder named "debug-universal" - this contains a library + headers for: iPhone, iPad, iOS Simulator

  5. Drag/drop the library file, and the headers folder (should be called "usr") into your iPhone/iPad project.
  6. Edit your build settings and set "C/C++ Compiler Version" = "LLVM Compiler 2.0"
  7. Edit your build settings and add "Other Linker Flags" = "-ObjC"
  8. Add all the REQUIRED APPLE FRAMEWORKS (see below)

  9. (Optional but recommended): Edit your build settings and add "Header Search Paths" = "/usr/include/libxml2"
  10. (Optional but recommended): Add the framework "libxml2.dylib"
  
### REQUIRED APPLE FRAMEWORKS

You must add the following frameworks for SVGKit to compile - unless you are embedding the whole project file (in which case Apple does it automatically)

  - CoreText
  - CoreImage
  - QuartzCore
  - CoreGraphics
  - UIKit

(only the first two are unusual - the rest you probably have by default in your iOS project template)

OS X Info
===

### Ultra-quick 'getting started'
-----

Open the project "Demo-OSX", select either Demo-OSX or ImageRepTest, build and run.

To use SVGKit, either create and display the image on screen:

    [view addSubview: [[SVGKLayeredImageView alloc] initWithSVGKImage: [SVGKImage imageNamed@"mySVGfile.svg"]]];
    
or load an image and convert it to an NSImage or NSBitmapImageRep object

    NSImage *newImage = [SVGKImage imageNamed:@"mySVGfile"].NSImage;
    NSBitmapImageRep *newImageRep = [SVGKImage imageNamed:@"mySVGfile"].bitmapImageRep;

Note that there is a naming conflict with one of OS X's headers, specifically a struct called *Comment* in the AIFF header. The following code __must be included in any source file that will include SVGKit headers, *before* any other header includes.__ A good place to put it would be in the prefix header.

    #define Comment AIFFComment
    #include <CoreServices/CoreServices.h>
    #undef Comment

## Usage

There are three ways to make SVGKit run on OS X:
  1. Use SVGKImageRep. Load the bundle, then you can load an SVG using NSImage. Note that this has similar bugs as the SVGKFastImageView (see below), but it is fairly simple to use.
  1. SVGKLayeredImageView is the suggested way to display SVGs on OS X. Note that if you add the view subclass via Interface Builder, the framework will complain when the view is inited.
  1. SVGKFastImageView is another subclass of NSView that you can use. Note that there currently is a bug that text will be upside-down unless the CALayer was inited by SVGKLayeredImageView. Also, like the iOS version, scaling and gradients don't work.

## Installation

Note that due to the different way SVGKit is built iOS and OS X means that you do *not* need to link to any framework except SVGKit and those that your app explicitly uses. 

If you use the SVGKImageRep bundle, you won't even need to link to SVGKit (you still can, though), but you will need to dynamically load the bundle using NSBundle. Note that SVGKImageRep copies the SVGKit framework inside itself.

### SVGKit

There is a sample project you can examine which copies the SVGKit framework into the Frameworks subdirectory of the app and sets the runpath to @loader_path/../Frameworks to load the framework. Note that you will need to set the header search path to search inside the framework's headers, as importing <SVGKit/SVGKit.h> won't work due to the headers' include structure.

### SVGKImageRep

There is a sample project you can examine which copies the SVGKImageRep into the PlugIns subdirectory inside the app. If you want to do something similar, to load SVGs using NSImage you need to load the bundle:

    NSBundle *SVGImageRepBundle = [NSBundle bundleWithURL:[[[NSBundle mainBundle] builtInPlugInsURL] URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"SVGKImageRep.bundle"]];
    BOOL loaded = [SVGImageRepBundle load];
